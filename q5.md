#Approach 1
```the function returns a res list```
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    ``` in the range of [0, n), each i is multiplied by 2 and ```
    ```appended to the end of res list ```
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

``` for each i, which is an element of returned list, the print fucntion is applied ```
for i in doubleL(5): 
    ``` second parameter specifies how the output should be concatenated```
    print(i, end=' : ')

#Approach 2
``` using comprehansive list, create a list. in the range of [0, 5), ```
```each value n is multiplied by 2 and added to the list. ```
```for each x in the newly created list apply print fucntion ```
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    ``` second parameter specifies how the output should be concatenated```
    print(x, end=' : ')

#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        ```each time yield statement is encountered, it stops function execution and returns value to caller ```
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

```generator object holds one value at a time ```
for i in doubleG(5):
        ```second parameter specifies how the output should be concatenated```
        print(i, end=' : ')
